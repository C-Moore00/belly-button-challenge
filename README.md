Module 14 Challenge!

Another one down! Only, too many more to go.

I ended up using .filter(function) to get the data out of the JSON.
For some reason the sample-metadata doesn't accept my newline characters. It's quite annoying, but it's functional, so, ???
The colour scale isn't quite the same on the bubble chart, but, there is a colour scale at all. I'd call that a win at this point.

I used a codeblock from https://jsfiddle.net/x4a8ejk6/ which originated from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43121679/how-to-append-option-into-select-combo-box-in-d3 to get the data ID's into the select box. This took far too long tbh.

All other code is my own work.
